# Programming Competition 

This repo contains the submitted code for the Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control Class at ETH ZÃ¼rich in Autumn Semester 2024/25 taught by Prof. Dr. Raffaello D'Andrea. 
This submission reached 5th rank in the course wide competition. 
It uses different approaches to solve a grid world MDP the shortest path problem, including value and policy iteration and its different modifications. The fastest implementation is based on policy itteration and solves a reduced linear system of equations in each itteration. It only consits of valid reachable states, which reduces the compuattional demand.
